## Devices Used
- ESP32 Devkit with WaveShare 240x240 LCD
- ESP32 C3 mini with a 240x240 touch display

## Usage Instructions
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Get some of the available [`watch faces here`](https://github.com/fbiego/watch-face-wearfit/blob/main/dials/HW21/README.md).
2. Upload the binary watch faces to the SPIFFS partition on your ESP32 microcontroller.

## Disclaimer
This project renders watch faces with randomized numbers and cannot accurately display the current time for practical use as a watch.
